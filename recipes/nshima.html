    <h2 class="name header">Description</h2>
    <p class="description">Nshima is a staple food in Zambia and other parts of Southern Africa. 
        It is made from ground maize (corn) flour, which is boiled in water until it thickens to a porridge-like consistency. 
        Typically, nshima is served as a thick, doughy side dish, and is often eaten with relishes or stews that include vegetables, meat, or fish. 
        It's a central part of many meals and is valued for its ability to be filling and versatile.
