    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish consisting of marinated meat that is cooked on a vertical rotisserie. 
        The meat, which can be lamb, chicken, beef, or a combination, is thinly sliced and served in a wrap or pita bread along with various accompaniments like tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, onions, and tahini or garlic sauce. 
        Shawarma is known for its rich and savory flavors, resulting from the marinade made of spices, yogurt, and lemon juice. It's a delicious and satisfying street food enjoyed around the world.
